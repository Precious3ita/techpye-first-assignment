            <h1>Why I Love Taekwondo</h1>
            <article>
                <p>There is this saying that people are wealth. I met a lot of good people with beautiful personalities in Taekwondo, starting from my coach, senior teammates, and my colleagues in the same rank. Normally, I have a love for sports, so the idea of going through university without sports did not sit well with me. I had no option but to hunt for a sport that would acknowledge my sportsmanship. That was the first time I stumbled upon Taekwondo, which I continue to participate in to this day. My love for the sport grew due to the camaraderie and shared interest we all had as a team.</p>
