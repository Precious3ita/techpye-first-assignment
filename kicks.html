        <p>In martial arts, different angles are used for different movements. For example, a spinning kick uses a
            360-degree angle, while kicks with multiple spins may use more than 360 degrees.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>45 Degree Kick:</b> is a fundamental kick in Taekwondo and is also known as a diagonal kick or the
                lower version of a roundhouse kick.</li>
            <li><b>Front Kick:</b> is a martial arts technique that involves lifting the knee and then straightening the
                leg to strike a target.</li>
            <li><b>Side Kick:</b> is a martial arts move that involves raising the knee, rotating the body, and
                extending the leg to strike an opponent.</li>
            <li><b>In-out Kick:</b>also known as the inside-outside crescent kick and outside-inside crescent kick, is a
                martial arts kick that involves swinging the knee of the kicking leg in a circular motion.</li>
            <li><b>Stretch Kick:</b> is a low-impact technique in martial arts that helps improve flexibility and
                kicking techniques.</li>
            <li><b>Out-in Kick:</b>In Taekwondo, an out-in kick is a crescent kick that's performed in two directions:
                <b>outward and inward</b>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><b>Outward crescent kick:</b>
                        The practitioner raises their extended leg as high as possible, slightly across the body's
                        centerline,
                        and then sweeps outward in a circular arc.</li>
                    <li><b>Inward crescent kick:</b>
                        The practitioner performs the same motions as the outward kick, but the direction of the kick is
                        reversed, originating from the outside of the body and heading towards the inside.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
