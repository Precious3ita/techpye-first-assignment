            <p>During the 2020/2021 National University games (NUGA) competition I was privileged to attend and compete
                for the University of Uyo where I completed my bachelor degree in mathematics in 2023.
                Another competition took place immediately after NUGA, it was called the Bayelsa open championship where
                I got my first medal in martial art (taekwondo). The sport taekwondo has shaped my life the best way I
                could ever imagine.</p>
