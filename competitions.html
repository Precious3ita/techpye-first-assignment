                <p>During the 2020/2021 National University games (NUGA) competition, I was privileged to attend and compete
                    for the University of Uyo, where I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2023. Another competition
                    took place immediately after NUGA, called the Bayelsa Open Championship, where I earned my first martial arts 
                    (taekwondo) medal. The sport of taekwondo has shaped my life in ways I could never have imagined.</p>
