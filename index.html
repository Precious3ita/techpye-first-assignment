        <article>
            <p>Taekwondo can be defined as a bare-hand combat discipline that involves using the whole body. It is the
                unarmed combat technique for self defense which entails skillfully applied techniques, including
                punching, blocks, parrying actions with hands and feet, dodges, jumping kicks, etc. The meaning of TAE
                is "to kick" or "smash with feet", KWON is "punching", while DO means "method" or "way".</p>

            <p>However, taekwondo does not just represent physical training, but also the development of one's spirit
                that carries over into all aspect of life. It is regraded as a way of thinking and a life pattern
                involving strict discipline.
