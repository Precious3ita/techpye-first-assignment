            <p>How I miss my sport and can not wait to return to the home I once knew.
                I know calling it a home I once knew sound a little extra for a sport but that is how i feel. I left my
                state for NYSC since August which put a pause on one of the best habit i developed and sport that I
                love. Having to miss
                the people and great family I left behind makes me so emotional,
                Like the saying that goes thus “taekwondo is not just a sport but a lifestyle”. I love my sport and I
                can not wait to get back to it and the beautiful people that made it worth while.</p>
