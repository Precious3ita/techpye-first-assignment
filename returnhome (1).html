                <p>How I miss my sport and cannot wait to return to the home I once knew.
                    I know calling it a home I once knew sounds a little extra for a sport, but that is how I feel. I
                    left my
                    state for NYSC in August, which put a pause on one of the best habits I developed and the sport I
                    love. Having to miss
                    the people and great family I left behind makes me so emotional.
                    Like the saying goes, "taekwondo is not just a sport but a lifestyle." I love my sport and I
                    cannot wait to get back to it and the beautiful people that made it worthwhile.</p>
